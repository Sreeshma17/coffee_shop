        <p class="p1">There is nothing better than sipping a good cup of coffee. On rainy days, a cup of Caramel
            Macchiato soothes
            and warms up my insides. On regularly hot days, a grande-sized (or maybe a venti) Caramel Frappuccino just
            beats the heat. Then on just plain old days, a bottle or two of iced coffee fills my energy up. It becomes a
            companion on lonely days or days that reading, or maybe writing, is all that matters. Coffee is just like
            life and the variety of it represents all aspects of mine. The smooth liquid never fails to give joy or
            satisfaction whenever it is being drank. It may be bitter like the challenges we face, but it can be strong
            like what we should be during challenges. It may be sweet and bursting with different flavors like life when
            things seem to go perfectly well. There are endless combinations of coffee that could be drank, it’s always
            up to us to find the right one.</p>
        <p class="p2">The first sip of coffee isn’t always the best one because it isn’t the perfect blend or it isn’t
            the right
            taste.On mornings, getting up early is always tolerable when coffee is waiting to be made. It doesn’t take a
            lot
            of effort to make to find it as something irrelevant, just heat up some water and pour in the
            right amount of instant coffee, creamer, and sugar, then done. To me it is more than a bothersome process.
            It the joy of seeing the powders swirling into a vortex, almost like a tornado, when stirring it so it can
            become a light brown mix that makes mornings much better. It’s the feeling of drinking the perfect blend
            that makes it much more.

            <p> Also known as a short black, an espresso is a single shot of coffee. No extra hot water is added,
                resulting in an intense and flavoursome drink.which forms the basis of many of the other drinks to follow,is produced by forcing
                hotwater</p>

            <h2>Doppio</h2>
            <p>A Doppio is a double shot of espresso with no added hot water or milk. This results in 60 ml of coffee.
                Doppio means 'double' in Italian.</p>

            <img src="./cappuchino.jpg" class="img3">
            <h2>cappuccino</h2>
            <p> cappuccino is one part espresso shot, one part textured milk and one
                part
                froth on top with a dusting of chocolate to finish.

                This is the same for a latte, flat white and mocha.</p>

            <h2>Long black</h2>
            <p>
                A long black is made by pouring a double-shot of espresso over hot water. Unlike an Americano which is
                made by adding hot water to the espresso shot, it retains the crema and is less voluminous,
                and more strongly flavoured.

        <div class="a">
            <img src="flat white.jpg" class="img5" >
            <h2>Flat white</h2>
            <p>
                A flat white is very similar to a latte, with un-textured milk
                resulting in espresso and steamed milk with little or no froth.
            </p>
